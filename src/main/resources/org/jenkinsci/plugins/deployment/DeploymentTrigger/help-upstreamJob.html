    Specify the job whose artifacts you'd like to watch for triggering this job.

    <p>
    The specified job must record fingerprints of the artifacts Chef/Puppet/etc deploys, when this trigger fires,
    the build to be started will see the corresponding build of the upstream job as the cause of the build, and
    receives all the parameters given to that upstream build.
